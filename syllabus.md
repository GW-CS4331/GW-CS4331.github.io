### Course Description and Learning Outcomes  ###

This course introduces students to modern cryptography with a focus on formal definitions and provably secure constructions of cryptographic protocols. Topics covered include secret-key and public-key encryption, message-authentication codes, digital signatures, and advanced topics.  This is a theoretical course and requires rigorous mathematical analysis, including deriving formal proofs, which will help you develop your on mathematical abstraction and problem solving skills. The lecture, and some lab sessions, will consist of in-class activities and students will be required to work in groups.  Additionally, the course includes a team research project where students will read and present on a recent research topic in cryptography.

**Prerequisites**
The main prerequisite for this course is a basic level of mathematical maturity. Students should feel comfortable with mathematical notation and be able to follow and apply mathematical reasoning. Basic
familiarity with asymptotic notation, mathematical logic, and probability are recommended.

Suggested prerequisites to cover this material include:

<u>For CSCI 4331:</u>
Any of CSCI 2312, CSCI 3212, CSCI 3313, or MATH 2971

<u>For CSCI 6331:</u>
CSCI 6212 or equivalent

**By the end of this course, students will be able to:**
  * Understand and differentiate between cryptographic definitions
  * Choose appropriate security definitions for given applications
  * Prove security of basic cryptographic constructions
  * Demonstrate familiarity with core building blocks of modern cryptography



**Online Platforms**

* Gradescope for homework submission and grades
* Blackboard for synchronous lectures and recordings
* Webpage for lecture slides, and other materials


**Course Outline**
  * See the course webpage for weekly schedule

### Textbook and Resources  ###

The course will largely follow the primary textbook.  Students can use it for reinforcement of the material, but the book is not required.

  * **Primary Text:** : [Introduction to Modern Cryptography](<https://wrlc-gwu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?context=L&vid=01WRLC_GWA:live&search_scope=DN_and_CI&isFrbr=true&tab=Everything&docid=alma99185917007604107") by Jonathan Katz and Yehuda Lindell, published by CRC Press 2014, 2nd edition.
  * **Alternate Text** : [Joy of Cryptography](https://joyofcryptography.com/) by Mike Rosulek. -- This book offers a somewhat different presentation of
much of the material covered in this course.


### Workload and Grading  ###
The course will be taught through live synchronous lectures. As a 3 credit course, it will require a minimum of 2.5 hours per week of direct instruction and minimum of 7 hours of independent learning. Over the course of the semester, your independent learning will include readings (lecture notes and/or textbook), and homeworks. The lectures will include presentation of material, exercises, and discussions.  All lectures will be recorded, and recordings will be provided on Blackboard.

**Grading:**
  
  | Activity  | Percentage of Grade
  | :--- |:---  |
  | Exam(s) | 40% (20% each)|
  | Homework | 30% |
  | Research Project | 20% |
  | Class Participation | 10% |

 
**Homework Policy:**
Homework will be assigned (approximately) weekly. Homework is due before class (by 12:45PM) on the
due date. Homework must be submitted via Blackboard by this time to receive credit. Homework can
be typed using your favorite tool (I am happy to help anybody interested in learning LaTex) or
handwritten and scanned. But, make sure that what you submit is legible as it is what will be graded.

Instead of numerical grades, I will use a version of “specifications grading” to evaluate level of
understanding instead of assigning point values to each mistake. Homework will be graded on an EMRN
rubric. These stand for the following:
* E -- Excellent, meets or exceeds expectation, clearly written and complete, clear understanding
* M -- Meets expectations, clear evidence of understanding, needs clean up or minor revision
* R -- Needs revision, shows partial understanding but significant gaps remain
* N -- Not satisfactory, fails to demonstrate understanding of problem or solution approach

Each problem on the homework will receive a letter grade according to this rubric. Your final homework
grade will depend on the number of problems on which you earn an E or M.  To help students build understanding of the material, I will allow two attempts at each homework problem with the grading as described below:
* To receive an E you must submit the correct solution before the original due date. No revisions
can receive an E.
* To receive an M, you can either receive an M on your initial attempt, submitted before the
deadline, or as a revision of a problem on which you received an R or N on your first attempt.
Important: To be allowed a revision, a first attempt must be submitted by the original deadline.
* If your initial submission, submitted by the deadline, receives an R or an N, you will be allowed
to revise and resubmit your solutions. Revised solutions can receive at most an M. You can resubmit solutions up to 1 WEEK after the initial deadline.
* Resubmissions of R and N grades are optional. If you do not submit one, you will keep your
original grade.

Final homework grades will be determined as follows:
* A-: > 85% of problems get a E or M
* B-: > 70% of problems get a E or M
* C-: > 60% of problems get a E or M
* D-: > 50% of problems get a E or M

Moving up from an A- to an A or an A+ will depend on the fraction of E's as opposed to M's and the
fraction of R's as opposed to N's. So, if you get 86% total E+M's with more E's than M's and more
R's than N's, you will earn an A. I will fine tune the exact boundaries for the plusses and minuses
depending on student performance, but you will have an approximation of your grade as the
semester progresses.

Students are welcome to discuss the problems and concepts with others in the class, but they should
solve the problems on their own and the solutions you submit MUST be your own. I reserve the right to
question you about your solution if it appears copied.

Additionally, students MAY NOT use online resources such as solutions to other homeworks, chegg.com,
or ChatGPT to find solutions. ChatGPT is terrible at answering crypto problems -- trust me, I tried -- and I
will know if you copy. Any problems found to be in violation of this policy will automatically receive an
N with no option to resubmit. Additionally, significant evidence of copying or using external solutions
will be considered in breach of the academic integrity code and will be prosecuted accordingly.

**Exam Policy**

There will be two exams. The first exam will cover the first half of the course, while the second exam
will be cumulative covering the full semester. For both exams, you will be allowed to bring one 8.5”x11”
piece of paper with notes to the exam. No calculators or computers are allowed.

### Course Policies  ###

 **If you have a disability, or a health or a family emergency, that may effect your participation in this course and wish to discuss academic accommodations, please contact me as soon as possible.**

**Grades will be posted on Blackboard** -- make sure you check and inform the instructors (by email) if you see any disparity between what is posted on blackboard and what you think your grades are.  You have one week after the grades are posted to contact the instructor -- after that there will be no regrading.

**Email policy:** You can send email to my GW email address. However, do not expect an instantaneous response. I encourage you to post questions on Piazza.

**Illness policy:** If you are ill and it will cause you to miss class, lab, or an assignment, you should let me know in advance if possible.  I cannot extend deadlines unless you contact me. You are still responsible for all material you missed, which generally will be available on the course website or on blackboard.

### University Policies ###

**Academic Integrity Code**
Academic integrity is an essential part of the educational process, and all members of the GW community take these matters very seriously. As the instructor of record for this course, my role is to provide clear expectations and uphold them in all assessments. Violations of academic integrity occur when students fail to cite research sources properly, engage in unauthorized collaboration, falsify data, and otherwise violate the [Code of Academic Integrity](https://studentconduct.gwu.edu/code-academic-integrity). If you have any questions about whether particular academic practices or resources are permitted, you should ask me for clarification. If you are reported for an academic integrity violation, you should contact Student Rights and Responsibilities (SRR) to learn more about your rights and options in the process. Consequences can range from failure of assignment to expulsion from the University and may include a transcript notation. For more information, refer to the [SRR website](http://studentconduct.gwu.edu/academic-integrity), email rights@gwu.edu, or call 202-994-6757. 

**University policy on observance of religious holidays**
Students must notify faculty during the first week of the semester in which they are enrolled in the course, or as early as possible, but no later than three weeks prior to the absence, of their intention to be absent from class on their day(s) of religious observance. If the holiday falls within the first three weeks of class, the student must inform faculty in the first week of the semester. For details and policy, see [provost.gwu.edu/policies-procedures-and-guidelines](http://provost.gwu.edu/policies-procedures-and-guidelines).

**Use of Electronic Course Materials and Class Recordings**
Students are encouraged to use electronic course materials, including recorded class sessions, for private personal use in connection with their academic program of study. Electronic course materials and recorded class sessions should not be shared or used for non-course related purposes unless express permission has been granted by the instructor. Students who impermissibly share any electronic course materials are subject to discipline under the Student Code of Conduct. Contact the instructor if you have questions regarding what constitutes permissible or impermissible use of electronic course materials and/or recorded class sessions. Contact Disability Support Services at [disabilitysupport.gwu.edu](https://disabilitysupport.gwu.edu/) if you have questions or need assistance in accessing electronic course materials.
